# tron-light-client

Initially, this was a PoC of light client verification of Tron Network's consensus. As it's been changing to fit the needs of [Untron](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron) project, it's transformed into a research repo with various scripts for dumping and parsing data from Tron protocol, and other experiments.
You can still find the old PoC logic in the old commits or [Untron's ZK circuit](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron/tree/main/circuit).
